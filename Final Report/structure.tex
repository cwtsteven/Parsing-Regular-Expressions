\chapter{Structure of our Agda files}
\par We have written 32 agda files with a total of 5785 lines of
code including comments and blank lines. These files can be divided into three categories:
1) definitions, 2) translation algorithms and 3) correctness
proofs. All the translation algorithms are inside the
\textbf{Translation} directory while the correctness proofs are inside
the \textbf{Correctness} directory. The other files belong to the
first category. Here is a simplified dependency graph of the files:

\par Readers are recommended to start with \textbf{Parsing-Regular-Expressions-in-Agda.agda}
,which is the index file of our formalisation. Now, let us look into each of the agda files. 

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{| p{5.2cm} | p{8.3cm} |}
\hline
\textbf{Parsing-Regular-Expressions-in-Agda.agda} & is the index
file of the Agda formalisation which imports all the other agda
files. Once this file has been compiled, all the other files will have been compiled as
well. \\ \hline 
\textbf{Subset.agda} & contains the definition and operations of subset. \\
  \hline
\textbf{../DecidableSubset.agda} & contains the definition and operations
                              of decidable subset. \\ \hline

                              completed and thus it is not used in any
                              other files. \\ \hline

                       algorithms. \\ \hline

\par We have also generated html files from the agda files. They are located in the \textbf{web} directory. Readers are
recommended to read the html files as it is much more
convenient. Similarly, readers can start with the
\textbf{Parsing-Regular-Expressions-in-Agda.html} which contains all
the links to other files.
