\abstract
\par In this project, we intend to study the feasibility of
constructing a certified translation algorithm of regular expressions to finite automata in Type
Theory. The translation consists of several steps: regular expressions
to \(\epsilon\)-NFA using Thompson's
construction; \(\epsilon\)-NFA to NFA by removing
\(\epsilon\)-transitions; DFA to DFA by powerset construction; and DFA
to MDFA by removing unreachable states and quotient construction. The
correctness of the translation is obtained by
showing that their accepting languages are equal. The above
translation and its correctness proofs are formalised in Agda -- a
dependently-typed functional programming language based on Type Theory.

Keywords: regular expression, finite automata, type theory, agda

\chapter{File description}

\par There are two directories in the .zip file: 1) \textbf{Code} and 2)
\textbf{web}. The \textbf{Code} directory contains all the
\textbf{.agda} files. In order to compile these files, first install
Agda by following the instructions stated in
\href{http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Download}{The
Agda Wiki}. Then open
\textbf{Parsing-Regular-Expressions-in-Agda.agda} with the IDE
recommended by the website. Press Ctrl-c Ctrl-l to compile the
file. The \textbf{Parsing-Regular-Expressions-in-Agda.agda} file is an
index file that imports all other agda files. Once this file has been
compiled, the other Agda files will have been compiled as well. 
\par The \textbf{web} directory contains all the html files generated
from the agda files. Readers are recommended to read the html files
instead of the agda files especially for those who do not have Agda
installed. The \textbf{Parsing-Regular-Expressions-in-Agda.html} is
the index file that contains the links to all other html files.
