\chapter{Conclusion}
\par In our project, the translation from regular expressions to DFA
and its correctness proof were formalised in Agda. However, the parts
related to the translation from DFA to MDFA were not completed. The
parts include the Table-filling algorithm that is used when
constructing the quotient set and the correctness of the
algorithm. However, the framework of the those parts was already formalised
in Agda; therefore, it is possible to complete the parts by filling in
the details. Therefore, it is still feasible to formalise the translation in
Type Theory.
