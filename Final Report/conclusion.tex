\chapter{Conclusion}
\par We have formalised the he translation from regular expressions to DFA
and its correctness proofs in Agda. We have fully also formalized the
conversion from DFA to MDFA. Further work includes several lemmas regarding the Table-filling
algorithm, which could be completed without major difficulties given
three or four more weeks, based on the development discussed in the report.

\par Throughout the project, we have made several decisions on the
representation of mathematical objects, for example, the set of states
\((Q)\) as a data type, accepting language of regular expressions as
general subset. These decisions have influenced the easiness or
difficulties in completing the proofs. Furthermore, there are many
similarites between writing proofs and writing codes. Therefore, in
conclusion, as a computer
science student without a strong mathematical background, I find it
quite feasible to formalise mathematics and programming logic in
Type Theory.
