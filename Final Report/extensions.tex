\section{Further Extensions}
\par In this section, we will discuss two possible extentions to
our project: 1) Myhill-Nerode Theorem and 2) Pumping Lemma. In these two
theorems, they both use the translation of regular expressions to DFA
in thier arguments. Therefore, they can be built on top of our
formalisation. 


\paragraph{Myhill-Nerode Theorem} In general, Myhill-Nerode Theorem
states that a language \(L\) is regular if and only if ... 


\paragraph{Pumping Lemma (for regular languages)} In general, the Pumping Lemma states that ...
